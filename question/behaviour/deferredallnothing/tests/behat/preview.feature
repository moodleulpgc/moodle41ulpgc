  @javascript @_switch_window
  Scenario: Preview a Multiple choice question and submit a partially correct response.
    When I am on the "Multi-choice-001" "core_question > preview" page logged in as "teacher1"
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I set the field "How questions behave" to "Deferred feedback (all or nothing)"
    And I press "Start again with these options"
    And I click on "One" "text"
    And I click on "Two" "text"
    And I press "Submit and finish"
    Then I should see "One is odd"
    And I should see "Two is even"
    And I should see "Mark 0.00 out of 1.00"
    And I should see "That is not right at all"
    And I switch to the main window
