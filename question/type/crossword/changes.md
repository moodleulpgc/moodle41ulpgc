# Change log for the crossword question type

## Changes in 1.0

* Basic implementation of this question type.
* Create crosswords for use in a Moodle quiz (or other places where questions can be used).
* In this version the words must be laid out in the grid manually, but the form validation will help you get that right.
* Supports characters in any alphabet that is in Unicode.
* With option for partial grading of words with accents.
* Supports answer containing spaces and hyphens.
* Feedback welcome.
