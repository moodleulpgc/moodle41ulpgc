  Scenario: A teacher views a markingguide report.
    Given I am logged in as "teacher1"

    When I navigate to "View > Marking Guide report" in the course gradebook
    And I set the field "Select activity" to "Test assignment 1 name"
    And I press "Submit"
    Then "Student 1" row "Grade" column of "generaltable" table should contain "80"
