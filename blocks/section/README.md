# Section block

This block displays the contents of a section as a block. The section can be from an entirely different course.

By default, this block displays section 0 of the course it is in.  
Students can click on the displayed resources and activities. If they are already enrolled in the displayed section's course, they are taken to the resource or activity. If they are not enrolled, they are prompted to enroll.  
Inspired by the Social Activities and Main Menu blocks.

## Usage examples

* A resource section between related courses
* Site-wide feedback activity
* Display the contents of a meta course on child courses
* Activities and Resources on My Moodle pages (added by admins/managers only)
