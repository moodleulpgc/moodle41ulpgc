Feature: Backup and restore of moodle exports
  In order to reuse my studentquizzes
  As a admin
  I need to be able to use the moodles backup and restore features

  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category |
      | Course 1 | C1        | 0        |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                |
      | student1 | Sam1      | Student1 | student1@example.com |
      | teacher1 | Sam1      | Teacher1 | teacher1@example.com |

  Scenario Outline: Restore moodle backups containing old StudentQuiz activity
    When I am on the "Course 1" "restore" page logged in as "admin"
    And I press "Manage backup files"
    And I upload "mod/studentquiz/tests/fixtures/<file>" file to "Files" filemanager
    And I press "Save changes"
    And I restore "<file>" backup into a new course using this options:
    And I log out
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course   | role    |
      | student1 | <course> | student |
      | teacher1 | <course> | teacher |
    And I am on the "<studentquiz>" "mod_studentquiz > View" page logged in as "<username>"
    Then I should see "Create new question"
    And "Start Quiz" "button" should exist
    And I should see "<questionname>"
    And I am on the "<studentquiz>" "mod_studentquiz > Ranking" page
    And "1" row "Points for latest correct attemps" column of "rankingtable" table should contain "<pos_1_correct_answered_points>"
    And "1" row "Total Points" column of "rankingtable" table should contain "<pos_1_total_points>"
    # TODO: These backups have good data selection, we could test for existence and correctness of these
    # TODO: A scenario with the new studentquiz so other datas could be tested too
    # TODO: We will have more testing after we fix the backup/restore issue.
