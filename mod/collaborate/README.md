# Collaborate Activity
A module for integration with Blackboard Collaborate.

Now your users can join a Collaborate with the Ultra experience 
session from their Moodle class. They don't need to install Java 
or download and open Java-reliant files to their devices.
The session opens in a new window or tab, depending on their browser settings.

When you install and enable the module, your instructors can 
add Collaborate to their classes. They can create virtual 
classrooms, offices, and meeting spaces to engage their
students in a more collaborative and interactive learning experience.
