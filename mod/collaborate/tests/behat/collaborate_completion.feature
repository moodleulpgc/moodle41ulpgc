Feature: Set one action as a completion condition for a Collab activity
  In order to ensure students are participating on sessions
  As a teacher
  I need to set a minimum number of conditions to mark the Collab activity as completed

  Background:

      | username | firstname | lastname | email |
      | teacher1 | Teacher | First | teacher1@example.com |

    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category |

    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on

    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Enable completion tracking | Yes |
    And I press "Save and display"
