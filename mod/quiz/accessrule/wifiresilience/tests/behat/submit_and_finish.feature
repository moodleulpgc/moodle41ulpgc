  In order to attempt quizzes with dodgy wifi
  As a student
  I need the submit and finish to be processed asynchronously.

    And quiz "Quiz Wifiresilience" contains the following questions:
      | Question A | 1 |
    And I am on the "Quiz Wifiresilience" "mod_quiz > View" page logged in as "student"
    And I press "Attempt quiz"
    And I wait "15" seconds
    And I click on "True" "radio" in the "Answer me A" "question"
    And I click on "Finish attempt ..." "link" in the "Quiz navigation" "block"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Submit and finish an attempt - working.
    When I press "Submit all and finish"
    And I click on "Submit all and finish" "button" in the "Confirmation" "dialogue"
    Then I should see "Finished" in the "State" "table_row"
    And the state of "Answer me A" question is shown as "Correct"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Submit and finish an attempt - failure.
    When I simulate losing the network by changing the submit URL
    And I press "Submit all and finish"
    And I click on "Submit all and finish" "button" in the "Confirmation" "dialogue"
    Then I should see "Exam submission failed"
    And I should see "Your responses could not be submitted. You can either try:"
    And "Submit all and finish (try again)" "button" should be visible
    And "Download copy of answers" "link" should be visible
    # Now successfully navigate away, or the following test will fail.
    And I click on "C1" "link" confirming the dialogue
