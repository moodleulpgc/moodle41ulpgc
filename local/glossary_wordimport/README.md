# moodle-local_glossary_wordimport
This plugin extends the core Glossary to support importing glossary entries from a Word file
where the entries are stored in structured tables.


## Installation

General plugin installation instructions are available at
http://docs.moodle.org/35/en/Installing_plugins

### Upgrading from an older to a newer version

The plugin does not store any plugin specific data in the
Moodle database. This means that you do not lose any data if you
uninstall it, and you can upgrade to another version of the
plugin simply by uninstalling the old version and then
installing the new version.
